This program shows how to implement a memory card game. Developer can change the card_count to increase the complexity level.

## Todo...
- Allow user to select the game level (12 cards, 20 cards, 30 cards). Currently there is a count_card variable.
- Add some kind of sound
- Better format the cards, right now they are as flat and simple as possible
- Adjust number of columns depending on the number of card (right now is define on css)
- CSS could use some transisions
- Completion should celebrate a bit more than just an alert popup!
- Use local storage (rather than in memory), so user can resume games later on
